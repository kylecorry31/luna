        Please consider posting in the New Feature Ideas [issue](https://github.com/kylecorry31/Trail-Sense/issues/2590) or [discussion](https://github.com/kylecorry31/Trail-Sense/discussions/316) instead of logging a new issue. If you do create a new issue, I may modify your description or create my own issue as a replacement to make it easier for development.
